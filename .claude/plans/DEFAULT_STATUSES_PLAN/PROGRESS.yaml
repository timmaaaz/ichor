context:
  current_focus: "Phase 3 plan reviewed and updated with fixes - Ready for implementation"
  next_task: "Implement Phase 3: Create alertbus, alertdb, update CreateAlertHandler, create alertapi"
  recent_changes:
    - "Phase 3 plan review completed (2025-12-31)"
    - "Fixed ExpiresDate type to *time.Time (nullable)"
    - "Added batch CreateRecipients method (avoid N+1)"
    - "Fixed error handling: return errors on invalid UUIDs (don't silently skip)"
    - "Simplified auth model: authentication only for user endpoints"
    - "Added admin /workflow/alerts endpoint for admins"
    - "Added Query/Count methods for admin access"
    - "Phase 2 marked complete on 2025-12-31"
  decisions:
    - "Decision: Use form config FK resolution (not template variables) for default status values"
    - "Decision: Names resolved to UUIDs at formdata processing time"
    - "Decision: Implementing phases sequentially to maintain stability"
    - "Decision: No caching for FK resolution (simplicity over optimization)"
    - "Decision: AsyncActionHandler pattern for self-contained async actions"
    - "Decision: Real handlers preferred over mocks for integration tests"
    - "Decision: Handlers own their event firing lifecycle (not queue manager)"
    - "Decision: Use minimal alertbus (not full business layer) - alerts are workflow-only creation with simple CRUD"
    - "Decision: Skip alertapp layer - validation inline in handlers for simple read/update operations"
    - "Decision: Recipient authorization in alertbus.Acknowledge/Dismiss (business layer, not middleware)"
    - "Decision: No delegate.Delegate needed - alerts are workflow-internal, timestamps are audit-only"
    - "Decision: No transaction support for now - orphaned alerts low-impact, acknowledge failure recoverable"
    - "Decision: Authentication only for user endpoints (no table-level permissions) - business layer filters by recipient"
    - "Decision: Allow any status transition (no state machine) - may add restrictions later if needed"
