## Your Task

### 1. Read PROGRESS.yaml

Read `.claude/plans/DEFAULT_STATUSES_PLAN/PROGRESS.yaml` to gather:
- Project status and metadata
- All completed phases
- Files created and modified
- Key decisions made
- Milestones achieved
- Any blockers encountered (and resolved)

### 2. Read README.md

Read `.claude/plans/DEFAULT_STATUSES_PLAN/README.md` to understand:
- Original project goals
- Success criteria
- Expected deliverables

### 3. Generate Executive Summary

Create a comprehensive summary report:

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Implement default status management using form configuration + workflow engine for automatic status assignment and transitions.

**Approach**:
1. Form-level configuration sets initial default statuses (synchronous, deterministic)
2. Workflow engine handles status transitions based on business logic (async, conditional)

## Accomplishments

### Phases Completed

[For each completed phase:]
#### Phase N: [Phase Name] ✅

**Category**: [Category]

**What Was Delivered**:
- [Deliverable 1]
- [Deliverable 2]

**Key Outcomes**:

- [Outcome 2]

### Implementation Statistics

- **Total Phases**: 3
- **Phases Completed**: N
- **Files Created**: X
- **Files Modified**: Y
- **Validation Checks Passed**: Z

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Changes

- FK default resolution in formdataapp
- Workflow event firing in allocate.go
- Automation rules for status transitions

### Key Files Modified

- `app/domain/formdata/formdataapp/formdataapp.go`
- `business/sdk/dbtest/seedmodels/forms.go`
- `business/sdk/dbtest/seedmodels/tableforms.go`
- `business/sdk/workflow/workflowactions/inventory/allocate.go`

---

## Key Decisions

- **Form Config Resolution**: Default values use human-readable names, resolved to UUIDs at processing time
- **No Template Variable Changes**: Existing template system unchanged
- **Workflow for Transitions**: Status changes after initial creation handled by workflow engine

---

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [✅/⏳] Orders/line items get Pending status by default
- [✅/⏳] Workflow triggers allocation on order create
- [✅/⏳] Status transitions to ALLOCATED on allocation success
- [✅/⏳] Alerts created on allocation failure
- [✅/⏳] Integration tests validate the complete flow
